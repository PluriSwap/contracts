# Escrow Contract Specification (Codeless)

## Overview
Provides a P2P escrow for crypto against off-chain settlement, with:
- Dual EIP-712 signatures to create and fund escrows atomically.
- Cross-chain fund delivery via Stargate integration for multi-network support.
- Comprehensive cost calculator for accurate fee estimation across networks.
- Reputation-aware dynamic fees via the Reputation Oracle.
- Reputation event emission (ingestion via ReputationEvents).
- Dispute resolution via an external ArbitrationProxy.
- DAO-configurable parameters and emergency pause.

## State Machine (Intent)
- States: INITIAL (pseudo), FUNDED, OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT, COMPLETE, CLOSED, HOLDER_DISPUTED, PROVIDER_DISPUTED.
- Decision Points: VALID (signature validation), FUNDED_TIMEOUT_PASSED (fundedTimeout check), PROOF_TIMEOUT_PASSED (proofTimeout check).
- Transitions:
  - INITIAL ‚Üí FUNDED: happens immediately after dual-signature validation and exact funds received.
  - FUNDED ‚Üí OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT: provider submits proof of off-chain service delivery.
  - OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT ‚Üí COMPLETE: holder releases crypto; fee deducted and funds disbursed.
  - FUNDED/OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT ‚Üí HOLDER_DISPUTED/PROVIDER_DISPUTED: party opens dispute; state reflects initiator.
  - FUNDED ‚Üí TIMEOUT_PASSED condition check: routes based on `fundedTimeout` status and context.
  - OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT ‚Üí TIMEOUT_PASSED condition check: routes based on `proofTimeout` status and context.
  - Any active ‚Üí CLOSED: terminal after completion, cancellation, or dispute ruling execution.

## Complete State Machine Paths

Based on the state machine diagram, here are all possible paths through the escrow lifecycle:

### Happy Path - Normal Completion
1. **INITIAL** ‚Üí `createEscrow(holder, provider, signature, funds, fundedTimeout, proofTimeout)` ‚Üí *VALID check* ‚Üí **FUNDED** 
2. **FUNDED** ‚Üí `provider_proof(escrow_id, proof)` ‚Üí **OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT**
3. **OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT** ‚Üí `holder_complete(escrow_id)` ‚Üí **COMPLETE**
4. **COMPLETE** ‚Üí `automatic closure` ‚Üí **CLOSED** ‚úì

### Early Cancellation Paths
1. **INITIAL** ‚Üí `createEscrow()` ‚Üí *VALID check* ‚Üí `invalid signature` ‚Üí **CLOSED** ‚úì
2. **INITIAL** ‚Üí `createEscrow()` ‚Üí *VALID check* ‚Üí `holder_cancelled(escrow_id)` ‚Üí **CLOSED** ‚úì
3. **INITIAL** ‚Üí `createEscrow()` ‚Üí *VALID check* ‚Üí `mutual_cancel(escrow_id, signature)` ‚Üí **CLOSED** ‚úì

### Timeout Resolution Paths
1. **FUNDED** ‚Üí `fundedTimeout exceeded` ‚Üí *FUNDED_TIMEOUT_PASSED check* ‚Üí `provider_lost(escrow_id)` ‚Üí **CLOSED** ‚úì
2. **OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT** ‚Üí `proofTimeout exceeded` ‚Üí *PROOF_TIMEOUT_PASSED check* ‚Üí `provider_won(escrow_id)` ‚Üí **CLOSED** ‚úì
3. **FUNDED** ‚Üí `fundedTimeout exceeded` ‚Üí *FUNDED_TIMEOUT_PASSED check* ‚Üí `dispute available: yes` ‚Üí **PROVIDER_DISPUTED** ‚Üí `provider_won(escrow_id)` ‚Üí **COMPLETE** ‚Üí **CLOSED** ‚úì

### Provider Dispute Paths
1. **FUNDED** ‚Üí `provider_dispute(escrow_id, fee)` ‚Üí **PROVIDER_DISPUTED** ‚Üí `provider_won(escrow_id)` ‚Üí **COMPLETE** ‚Üí **CLOSED** ‚úì

### Holder Dispute Paths  
1. **OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT** ‚Üí `holder_dispute(escrow_id, fee)` ‚Üí **HOLDER_DISPUTED** ‚Üí `holder_won(escrow_id)` ‚Üí **CLOSED** ‚úì

### Failed Completion Paths
1. **COMPLETE** ‚Üí `provider_lost(escrow_id)` ‚Üí **CLOSED** ‚úì

### State Transition Summary
- **Terminal States**: CLOSED, COMPLETE (which leads to CLOSED)
- **Dispute States**: HOLDER_DISPUTED, PROVIDER_DISPUTED (both can resolve to either CLOSED or COMPLETE)
- **Active States**: FUNDED, OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT
- **Decision Points**: VALID (signature validation), FUNDED_TIMEOUT_PASSED (fundedTimeout check), PROOF_TIMEOUT_PASSED (proofTimeout check)
- **Entry Point**: INITIAL (pseudo-state for creation initiation)

### Key Path Characteristics
- All paths eventually lead to **CLOSED** (the final terminal state)
- **COMPLETE** is a penultimate state that always transitions to **CLOSED**  
- Disputes can be initiated from **FUNDED** (provider) or **OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT** (holder)
- **Dual Timeout System**: 
  - `fundedTimeout`: Limits time for provider to deliver service and submit proof
  - `proofTimeout`: Limits time for holder to complete after proof submission
- Timeouts provide context-sensitive protection: 
  - FUNDED state timeout ‚Üí holder refund (provider didn't deliver)
  - OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT state timeout ‚Üí provider payout (provider delivered, holder didn't complete)
- Multiple cancellation mechanisms exist at different stages for flexibility

## Cross-Chain Functionality

### Stargate Integration
The escrow contract supports cross-chain fund delivery using Stargate, enabling providers to receive funds on different networks than where the escrow was created. This provides flexibility for global P2P transactions.

**Supported Networks**: All Stargate-supported chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, BSC, Avalanche, Fantom, etc.)

**Cross-Chain Flow**:
1. Escrow created on holder's network (e.g., Ethereum) with provider's contract address (same network) and destination address (any network)
2. Contract automatically detects if destination differs from source network
3. On completion, funds are either:
   - Sent directly to provider (same network)
   - Bridged via Stargate to destination network (cross-chain)

### Escrow Agreement Structure
```solidity
struct EscrowAgreement {
    address holder;             // Holder's address on contract network (for signatures/interactions)
    address provider;           // Provider's address on contract network
    uint256 amount;             // Escrow amount in native token
    uint256 fundedTimeout;      // Timeout for FUNDED state (provider must deliver service)
    uint256 proofTimeout;       // Timeout for OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT state (holder must complete)
    uint256 nonce;              // Scoped nonce for replay protection
    uint256 deadline;           // Signature validity deadline
    // Destination Configuration
    uint16 dstChainId;          // Destination chain ID (0 = same chain as contract)
    address dstRecipient;       // Final recipient address (can be different from provider)
    bytes dstAdapterParams;     // Stargate parameters (gas for destination, etc.)
}
```

### Automatic Cross-Chain Detection
- **Same Network**: If `dstChainId == 0` or equals current chain ID, funds sent directly to `dstRecipient`
- **Cross-Chain**: If `dstChainId` differs from current chain, funds bridged via Stargate to `dstRecipient` on target network
- **Cost Calculation**: Automatically includes bridge fees when cross-chain delivery detected

### Cost Calculator
The contract provides comprehensive cost estimation for both same-chain and cross-chain escrows, helping users understand all fees upfront.

**Cost Components**:
- **Base Escrow Fee**: Reputation-aware percentage fee (deducted from deposit)
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Fee**: Stargate protocol fees (deducted from deposit)
- **Destination Gas**: Gas costs on destination network (deducted from deposit)
- **Dispute Costs**: Arbitration fees (paid separately by disputer to prevent abuse)

```solidity
struct EscrowCosts {
    uint256 escrowFee;          // Platform fee (deducted from deposit, goes to DAO)
    uint256 bridgeFee;          // Stargate bridge fee (deducted from deposit)
    uint256 destinationGas;     // Gas for destination chain (deducted from deposit)
    uint256 totalDeductions;    // Sum of deductions from deposit (excludes dispute costs)
    uint256 netRecipientAmount; // Amount recipient receives after platform/bridge fees
    uint256 maxDisputeCost;     // Max potential dispute cost (paid separately by disputer)
}
```

) view returns (uint256)
```
- Called by: **Anyone** (view function, no gas for external calls)
- Returns: Required arbitration fee based on disputer's reputation

### Gas Payment Summary
**Important: Platform and bridge fees deducted from deposit, dispute fees paid separately**

- **Escrow Creation**: Holder pays gas + deposits escrow amount in crypto
- **State Progression**: Party triggering transition pays gas only
- **Escrow Completion**: Holder pays gas only
  - Same-chain: Platform fee deducted from deposit, remainder to recipient
  - Cross-chain: Platform fee + bridge fees deducted from deposit, remainder bridged
- **Disputes**: Disputer pays gas + arbitration fee (paid separately to prevent abuse)
  - Arbitration fee refunded to winner, forfeited to DAO if loser
  - **No appeals**: Arbitration rulings are final
- **Timeouts**: Anyone can trigger (pays gas, may receive incentive from DAO)
- **Dispute Resolution**: Arbitration system handles final execution gas
- **Evidence Submission**: Each party pays their own gas costs
- **Cost Estimation**: View functions (no gas cost for external calls)
- **Network Discovery**: View functions (no gas cost for external calls)

**Fee Handling**:
- **From Deposit**: Platform escrow fee, bridge fees (cross-chain)
- **Paid Separately**: Arbitration fees (to prevent frivolous disputes)
- **Refund Mechanism**: Winning disputers get arbitration fees back, losers forfeit to DAO
- **Final Rulings**: No appeals - arbitration decisions are final and binding

## Functional Behavior

- Creation (dual signatures)
  - Both holder and provider sign identical `EscrowAgreement` off-chain (EIP-712).
  - Holder relays `createEscrow` with both signatures and exact ETH equal to the amount.
  - Agreement includes holder, provider, amount, dual timeouts (fundedTimeout, proofTimeout), nonce, deadline, plus destination details (dstChainId, dstToken, dstRecipient, dstAdapterParams).
  - Provider address must be on same network as contract (for signatures/interactions).
  - Destination recipient can be any address on any Stargate-supported network.
  - Nonce must be scoped (e.g., per-provider) to avoid cross-tenant collisions.

- Off-chain service proof
  - Only the provider can register proof; proof is a short reference (e.g., IPFS CID) recorded for audit.

- Completion
  - Only the holder can complete after provider's proof; all fees deducted from deposited crypto; DAO receives platform fee; net remainder is paid out.
  - Contract automatically detects delivery method based on agreement's `dstChainId`:
    - Same-chain: Platform fee deducted, remainder transferred to `dstRecipient`
    - Cross-chain: Platform fee + bridge fees deducted, remainder bridged to `dstRecipient` on destination network
  - All fees (platform + bridge) deducted from the original crypto deposit, holder only pays gas.
  - Fee calculation is reputation-aware (holder/provider), bounded by min/max, and SHOULD be snapshotted at creation to prevent mid-escrow reputation manipulation.

- Cancellation
  - Mutual cancel via counterparty authorization; unilateral cancellations as per policy (e.g., before off-chain proof or pre-agreed windows).

- Disputes
  - Either party may open a dispute via the ArbitrationProxy; arbitration fee is paid separately by the disputer to prevent frivolous disputes.
  - Disputer pays gas + arbitration fee directly (not from escrow deposit) to ensure skin in the game.
  - Evidence submission is possible while dispute active.
  - **Final rulings**: No appeals mechanism - arbitration decisions are binding and final.
  - Ruling is enforced via `executeRuling` callback; funds distributed according to ruling, arbitration fee refunded to winner.
  - If disputer loses, arbitration fee is forfeited to DAO; if disputer wins, fee is refunded to them.

- Timeouts (Dual System)
  - **FUNDED State Timeout** (`fundedTimeout`): Time limit for provider to deliver service and submit proof.
    - If `fundedTimeout` exceeded: Full refund to holder (provider failed to deliver).
    - Anyone may trigger timeout resolution and receive small incentive.
  - **OFFCHAIN_PROOF_SENT State Timeout** (`proofTimeout`): Time limit for holder to complete after proof submission.
    - If `proofTimeout` exceeded: Full payment to provider (provider delivered, holder failed to complete).
    - Anyone may trigger timeout resolution and receive small incentive.
  - Both timeouts are set in the original escrow agreement and cannot be modified post-creation.

- Events
  - Emit state-change events for on-chain audit.
  - Emit reputation events for both parties at key milestones (creation, off-chain proof sent, completion, dispute events).

- Access control & pause
  - DAO-only for configuration updates, arbitration proxy updates, and pause/unpause.
  - Party-specific operations restricted to the concerned party.
  - Paused state blocks new creations and state changes, except DAO-defined emergency pathways (e.g., executing dispute rulings).

## Fees (Intent)
**Fee Structure**: Platform/bridge fees deducted from deposit, dispute fees paid separately
- Base fee percentage, with min/max, applied to escrow amount and influenced by combined reputation (weighted average, provider heavier weight). Deducted from deposit.
- Cross-chain bridge fees (Stargate) deducted from deposit when cross-chain delivery occurs.
- Dispute fee bands determined by disputer's reputation. **Paid separately by disputer** to prevent frivolous disputes and ensure proper economic incentives.
- Platform and bridge fees bounded and sent to DAO (treasury) or configured recipient from the deposited funds.
- Arbitration fees held by contract and refunded to winners, forfeited to DAO by losers.
- **Final arbitration**: No appeals mechanism - rulings are binding and final.
- Fee and/or scores SHOULD be snapshotted at creation.
- Recipients receive net amount after platform/bridge fees are deducted from the original deposit.

## External Interface (Exposed Methods Only)

// Creation and agreement helpers
function createEscrow(
    bytes calldata agreementEncoded,
    bytes calldata holderSignature,
    bytes calldata providerSignature

function pause() external;
function unpause() external;
```

## Security and Invariants
- Dual-signature validation includes domain separation, deadline, and scoped nonces.
- No reliance on tx.origin anywhere (including Arbitration flows).
- All ETH transfers via .call with success checks; use CEI and reentrancy guards.
- Inputs validated (non-zero addresses, positive amounts, timeout bounds, bounded strings).
- Dispute fee refund uses the exact recorded amount at dispute creation.

## Deployment & Configuration
- Constructor receives DAO, ReputationOracle, ReputationEvents, StargateRouter, and initial `EscrowConfig`.
- Config must satisfy min/base/max relationships and timeout bounds.
- Stargate integration requires router address and supported chain/token mappings.
- Cross-chain configurations must be validated against Stargate pool availability.

## Testing Scope (Intent)
- EIP-712 correctness, creation, state transitions, fee calculations and bounds, dispute lifecycle (final rulings, no appeals), timeout behavior (refund buyer), events integration, pause behavior, access control, and reentrancy.
- Cross-chain functionality: Stargate integration, bridge fee calculations, cross-chain completion flows, destination chain validation.
- Cost calculator accuracy: fee estimation across networks, reputation impact on costs, bridge fee queries.
- Dispute finality: Testing that arbitration rulings are final and binding with proper fee handling.
