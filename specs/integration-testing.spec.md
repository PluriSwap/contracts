# PluriSwap Integration Testing Specification (Codeless)

## Overview
Defines end-to-end integration tests across DAO, Reputation Oracle, ReputationEvents, ArbitrationProxy, and Escrow. Validates user journeys, cross-contract state coherence, economics, and emergency operations.

## Environment Setup (Intent)
- Deploy DAO (5 signers, configured delays/limits).
- Deploy Oracle with DAO; add a trusted data provider.
- Deploy ReputationEvents in allowlist mode; authorize Escrow and ArbitrationProxy.
- Deploy ArbitrationProxy with DAO and initial fee config; add initial support agent(s); authorize Escrow.
- Deploy Escrow with DAO, Oracle, Events, and initial fee/timeout config; set ArbitrationProxy.

## E2E User Journeys
- Happy-path escrow:
  - High-reputation buyer and seller; create escrow via dual signatures; buyer provides fiat proof; seller completes; fees charged at snapshot; DAO receives fee; reputation events emitted; oracle updated off-chain and reloaded.
- First-time users:
  - No reputation → maximum fees; complete; initial score creation; subsequent transactions reflect improved fees.
- Dispute flow:
  - Open dispute from FUNDED/FIAT_TRANSFERRED; submit bilateral evidence; support agent resolves; escrow callback executes ruling; fee refund to winner using exact paid value; events emitted; oracle updated accordingly.

## Cross-Contract Scenarios
- Dynamic fees:
  - Preload varied reputation; confirm fee bands and bounds; snapshot behavior validated against manipulation.
- Oracle unavailability:
  - Pause oracle; escrow creation falls back (policy-dependent) or blocks; unpause and resume normal operation.
- Events lifecycle:
  - Ensure consistent ingestion by ReputationEvents; off-chain correlation across contracts.

## Governance Operations
- Coordinated updates:
  - DAO proposes and executes fee changes across Escrow and ArbitrationProxy; verify contracts reflect new parameters.
- Emergency shutdown:
  - Pause all components; verify new operations blocked and critical closures still possible; recover with controlled unpausing.
- DAO migration:
  - Update DAO references across all contracts, transfer treasury, and verify control fully transitions.

## Advanced Scenarios
- Multi-escrow concurrency:
  - Multiple escrows in various states; concurrent transitions; isolation guarantees.
- Bulk operations:
  - Batch oracle loads; many simultaneous events; gas and latency characterization.

## Security and Resilience
- Reentrancy across boundaries (Escrow payouts, Arbitration callbacks).
- Economic attacks (fee avoidance, dispute spam); ensure reputation-based fees and bounds deter abuse.
- Data consistency and event ordering under contention; recovery after network congestion.

## Performance & Longevity
- Load tests at target throughputs (escrows/disputes/events).
- Long-run simulation (months) to observe parameter stability, fee revenue, and dispute latencies.

## Success Criteria
- Functional: All defined flows complete with expected state and funds distribution.
- Performance: Gas within targets, throughput sustained.
- Security: No successful reentrancy or governance bypasses.
- Reliability: Deterministic state consistency across contracts; event auditability.
